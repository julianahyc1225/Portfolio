website, and ones who are current users. The website is designed to be comprehensive enough to lead a potential user to explore all of Circular‚Äôs offerings and find a product that they would love to experience. Once a steady base of users has been built up, the website begins to serve a second purpose: to allow current users to manage their current products, continue finding new products to try, and to configure their desires in the most effective way.</p>\n            <p>This is a group project and I am mainly responsible for organizing and analyzing peer and user feedback. Through this project, I aim to gain experience in the iterative design process, with a focus on collecting feedback from design peers and interpreting results from user testing experiments, and eventually actualizing the feedback to changes in the design product to improve <b>user experience</b>.</p>\n            </div>\n\n         <div className='Project_process'>\n            <div className='section_title'>Process</div>\n\n            <div className='section_subtitle'>STEP 1: Ideating through sketches</div>\n                <p>We created 4 different possible designs for circular below, trying to capture a broad range of design alternatives for circular.</p>\n                <p>An attached pdf with our sketches are shown below:</p>\n\n              <iframe className='iframe' src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/\" + \"images/iterative_sketches.pdf\"}></iframe>\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            <div className='section_subtitle'>STEP 2: Prototyping (Low-Fi)</div>\n            <p>We then developed a series of wireframes integrating the best design ideas from our sketches.</p>\n            <p>We wanted to emphasize that the key idea of Circular is that it is a marketplace with unconventional means of renting the products. Our sketches were made of pages needed to create a functioning marketplace, and from there we created a flow that covered two use cases, first time users and returning customers.</p>\n            <p>Here are some of the ideas that guided our wireframing process:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>We decided on having the users first go through a landing page because Circular‚Äôs company mission serves as a guide to how the marketplace works, as well as setting them apart from other marketplaces.</li>\n                <li>A logged out state and logged in state exist for certain pages, to both prevent new users from being overwhelmed with information irrelevant in deciding to join the marketplace, and making the flow of information more efficient to returning users. E.g the explore page showcasing rental information in the logged in state, but is missing in the logged out state.</li>\n                <li>We wanted to make sure users are aware of the actions they can take when renting a rental, so information regarding it was included in multiple areas, such as the Landing page in ‚ÄúHERE‚ÄôS HOW IT WORKS‚Äù and the Product page in ‚ÄúWhat happens then?‚Äù.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>An attached pdf with our wireframes are shown below:</p>\n                <iframe className='iframe' src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/\" + \"images/iterative_wireframe.pdf\"}></iframe>\n            <br/><br/>\n\n    <div className='section_subtitle'>STEP 3: Prototyping (Hi-Fi)</div>\n    <br/>\n    <iframe className='iframe' src={\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FOCjo8lVwty9xodJxQsX54j%2FCircular%253A-Initial-High-Fidelity-Mockups%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A99%26t%3D6hUOivWMhTGj7ZBT-1\"}></iframe><br/>\n    <a className='figma_link' href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/OCjo8lVwty9xodJxQsX54j/Circular%3A-Initial-High-Fidelity-Mockups?node-id=1%3A99&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A99&fbclid=IwAR2tHjtlL-tSsfecCNyjQ0dKjvnCk_WXrvwwNm1wfTG7zdTSAhrbjnf-g80\" target=\"_blank\">Accessing the protoype</a>\n    <br/>\n    <b>Design Considerations</b>\n    <p>We then proceeded to convert our wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes.
