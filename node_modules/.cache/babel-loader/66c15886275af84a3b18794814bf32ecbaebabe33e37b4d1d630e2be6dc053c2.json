However, users who buy coffee at a library are likely to be mentally tired from academic work (or \"grinding\"). They hence reflect more nuanced problems that can further improve the usability of the interface once fixed:<br/>\n                    <ul>\n                    <li>Many options are offered but their differences are not shown<br/></li>\n                    <li>No way for the users to directly observe how full the cup is unless they pull the cup out <br/></li>\n                    </ul>\n\n                 </div>\n                 <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/\" + \"images/persona2.png\"}></img>\n            </div>\n            \n            <br/><br/>\n\n            <div className='section_subtitle'>Storyboard</div>\n            <img id='persona_storyboard' src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/\" + \"images/storyboard.jpg\"}persona_storyboard></img>\n        </div>\n\n         <div className='Project_takeaways'>\n            <div className='section_title'>Takeaways</div>\n                <ul style={{lineHeight:'2.8rem'}}>\n                    <li>This is my first taste of user experience research.
